Upon going on the note page, all previous saved notes are present
    - Maybe loop through all ids in notes/:id and retrieving it in list format

When save button is clicked 
    - POST the data to db.json in a JSON format
        - e.g., :

        app.POST(`/notes/:${id}`, (req, res) => {
        res.json({
        title: 'title',
        text: 'textcontent',
        id: ,
  });
});

When Note on left hand side is clicked 
    - GET the data from db.json by:
        - Matching the ID of the item clicked with the GET response? (maybe loop through each ID and whichever ID matches, display that note)

When delete button clicked 
    - DELETE the data matching the ID of the clicked item with ID to be deleted


Separate routes into another file!!
